<p>You use phylotaxy music, a web application, for
generating a music
theme. A music theme is a small suite
of music notes, a melodic material.</p>
<p>A wellknown theme is at the start of Bach's 2nd
fugue in C minor.</p>

<h3>Phylotaxy</h3>
<p>Phylotaxy means &quot;shape of leaves&quot;.
It is the
science developped by botanist,
mathematicians and physicists
to understand why plants
have the shape they have.</p>
<p>Those guys have fun jobs.</p>
<p>In the office of Stephane D.,
a &quot;spiral plants&quot; specialist I
visited, the shelves are full of
beautiful
dried specimen that people
sent to him
from all over the world.
Each plant has spectacular
spiral arragenements of leaves
that run upward the trunks.</p>
<p>A common spiral plant is the pinecone.</p>
<p>Stephane taught me that when
the trunk grows,
the cells
at the stem divide themselves. New cells
end up building
the trunk but regularly,
one of them differentiates and
becomes a leave.
Because this happens on a regular tempo,
the leaves arrange themselves along
the trunk
in spiral patterns.
Stephane pointed out that if you draw
a curve around the trunk to isolate
one leave cell from
newer leave cells, you end up drawing
the &quot;front curve&quot;
of the plant growth.</p>
