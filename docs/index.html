    <h1>Phyllotaxy Music</h1>
    <article class="page-content">
        <p>This site describes phyllotaxy generated music.</p>
<p>Phyllotaxy and music are two concepts far appart but they can be related.</p>
<p>Precisely, phyllotaxy can help to generates a music
theme, a suite of music notes, a melodic material.</p>
<h3>Cannon</h3>
<p>A wellknown music theme is at the start of Bach's 2nd
fugue in C minor. It starts with the C note.</p>
<img src="./images/bach2ndFugue.png" style="height: 100px; width: auto;">
<p>This theme is repeated with different voices, sometimes overlapping.</p>
<img src="./images/bach2ndFugue_large.png" style="height: 400px; width: auto;">
<p>Let's a have a look to this memorable piece. The first voice
starts with a C on the first measure. On the third measure, the theme starts again, but it starts with a G. A G
is seven half tone higher, or a &quot;quint&quot; in music parlance, above a C.
Then, on this third measure, this second voice
overlaps harmonuously the first voice. The G of the second voice is played with a B flat
of the first voice, that is four half tone or a musical third.
The next note, a F# on the second voice, is played along a A on the first voice, also a
third. And so one.</p>
<p>It is the composer's chore
to have the theme well suited for supporting overlapping itself.</p>
<p>Having a theme that repeats itself harmonously with a shift in beats and tone is called a cannon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pachelbel's Canon in D</li>
<li>&quot;Row, Row, Row Your Boat&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Phylotaxy will help us to compose theme that are suited for cannon with the following idea :
if a cannon theme is a curve on a plan, it must overlap with itself with an horizontal and a vertical shift.</p>
<h3>Phylotaxy</h3>
<p>Phylotaxy means &quot;shape of leaves&quot;
(&quot;phyllo&quot; is greek for leave and &quot;taxy&quot; is greek for shape).
It is the
science developped by botanist,
mathematicians and physicists
to understand why plants
have the shape they have.</p>
<p>In the office of Stephane Douady,
a &quot;spiral plants&quot; specialist I
visited, the shelves are full of
beautiful
dried specimen that people
sent to him
from all over the world.
Each plant has spectacular
spiral arragenements of leaves
that run upward the trunks.</p>
<p>A common spiral plant is the pinecone.</p>
<p>Stephane taught me that when
the trunk grows,
the cells
at the stem divide themselves. New cells
end up building
the trunk but regularly,
one of them differentiates and
becomes a leave.
Because this happens on a regular tempo,
the leaves arrange themselves along
the trunk
in spiral patterns.
Stephane pointed out that if you draw
a curve around the trunk to isolate
one leave cell from
newer leave cells, you end up drawing
the &quot;front curve&quot;
of the plant growth.</p>
<img src="./images/growthCurveOnPineCone.png" style="height: 300px; width: auto;">
<p>Stephane then compared a new leave cell
to the last one.
Because leave cells appear regularly,
a new cell is
always located with the same distance
above and the
same angle sideway,
a rotation near 168 degrees,
related to the golden ratio.
Therefore, the &quot;front curve&quot; has
this interesting geometric feature :
but on the new leave cell,
it overlaps itself
after an upward translation
and a rotation. Let's demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Use a grey pen and draw the unfolded the front curve on a piece
of paper.</p>
<img src="./images/fistVoiceSVGimage.svg" style="height: 100px; width: auto;">
<p>Use a green pen and draw the same curve at the right of the first.</p>
<img src="./images/SVGfirstVoiceAndFirstVoiceShiftedRight.svg" style="height: 100px; width: auto;">
<p>Draw it again
on a tracing paper with a red pen and put the tracing
paper above and
shift it a bit to the right and
a bit to the top.</p>
<img src="./images/SVGfirstVoiceAndFirstVoiceShiftedRightAndSecondVoice.svg" style="height: 125px; width: auto;">
<p>We did it ! The overlapping
is perfect
except for one space that have
the shape of an eye (
the place for the leave).</p>
<h3>Generating a theme form the front curve</h3>
<p>Now take take the first drawing and add a canevas
of vertical measure lines and horizontal pitch lines.</p>
<p>For the pitch lines, the spacing between pitch line
follows the scale of your choice. If you
choose a C minor scale, the tone differences between
notes are 1, 1/2, 1, 1, 1/2, 1 and 3/2.</p>
<img src="./images/SVGfirstVoiceAndFirstVoiceShiftedRightWithGrid.svg" style="height: 300px; width: auto;">
<p>Now, along the front curve, when it intersect the
measure lines,
draw some notes of your choosing.</p>
<img src="./images/SVGfirstVoiceAndFirstVoiceShiftedRightWithGridWithNotes.svg" style="height: 300px; width: auto;">
<p>With the second voice note, this gives</p>
