    <article class="page-content">
        <p>This site describes phyllotaxy generated music.</p>
<p>Precisely, phyllotaxy helps to generates a music
theme. A music theme is a small suite
of music notes, a melodic material.</p>
<p>A wellknown music theme is at the start of Bach's 2nd
fugue in C minor.</p>

<h3>Phylotaxy</h3>
<p>Phylotaxy means &quot;shape of leaves&quot;.
It is the
science developped by botanist,
mathematicians and physicists
to understand why plants
have the shape they have.</p>
<p>In the office of Stephane Douady,
a &quot;spiral plants&quot; specialist I
visited, the shelves are full of
beautiful
dried specimen that people
sent to him
from all over the world.
Each plant has spectacular
spiral arragenements of leaves
that run upward the trunks.</p>
<p>A common spiral plant is the pinecone.</p>
<p>Stephane taught me that when
the trunk grows,
the cells
at the stem divide themselves. New cells
end up building
the trunk but regularly,
one of them differentiates and
becomes a leave.
Because this happens on a regular tempo,
the leaves arrange themselves along
the trunk
in spiral patterns.
Stephane pointed out that if you draw
a curve around the trunk to isolate
one leave cell from
newer leave cells, you end up drawing
the &quot;front curve&quot;
of the plant growth.</p>
<img src="./images/growthCurveOnPineCone.png" style="height: 300px; width: auto;">
<p>Stephane then compared a new leave cell
to the last one.
Because leave cells appear regularly,
a new cell is
always located with the same distance
above and the
same angle sideway,
a rotation near 168 degrees,
related to the golden ratio.
Therefore, the &quot;front curve&quot; has
this interesting geometric feature :
but on the new leave cell,
it overlaps itself
after an upward translation
and a rotation. Let's demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Use a grey pen and draw the unfolded the front curve on a piece
of paper.</p>
<img src="./images/fistVoiceSVGimage.svg" style="height: 200px; width: auto;">
<p>Use a green pen and draw the same curve at the right of the first.</p>
