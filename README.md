## what is it ?

You use phylotaxy music, a web application, for 
generating a music
theme. A music theme is a small suite 
of music notes. Think of it as something you
 can whistle.

By turning 
knobs in the application, you generates a musical theme . You can hear it in the app by way of a simple 
webaudio synthesizer and
If you want to compose something 
more elaborate, you can export it
to a musicxlm file and import it 
in
a score editing 
software like musescore.

Phylotaxy means "shape of leaves". 
It is the 
science botanist, mathematicians and physicists 
have developed to understand why plants
have the shape they have.

Those guys have fun jobs. In the office of Stephane D.,  
a "spiral plants" specialist I 
visited, the shelves are full of beautiful 
dried spécimen that people send him
from all over the world. Each plant has spectacular
spiral arragenement of leaves. They form
spirals that run upward the trunks.

Stephane taught me that when the trunk grows, the cells
at the stem divide themselves. Those news end up building
the trunk but regularly, one of them differentiates and
becomes a leave. Because this happens on a regular tempo, the leaves arrange themselves along the trunk
in spiral patterns. Stephane pointed that if you draw
a line around the trunk to isolate one leave cell from
newer leave cells, you end up drawing the "front line"
of the plant growth.

Compared to the last leave cell, a new leave cell is 
always located with the same distance above and the
same angle sideway, a rotation near 168 degree, related to the golden ratio. Therefore, the "front line" has 
this interesting geometric feature : it overlaps itself
after an upward translation and a rotation.


Now, unfolds the front line on a piece of paper. 
If you draw it again
on a tracing paper, you can check by 
moving the tracing paper that 
the front line overlaps itself
if you shift it a bit to the right and 
a bit to the top. The overlapping 
is perfect 
except for one space that have
the shape of an eye (the place for the leave).

It happens that a musical theme 
suitable for polyphonic harmony,
a canon for instance,
is a theme that is played twice.
The second time the theme is played,
it is played with a 
shift in time and a shift in pitch 
(a fifth for instance).

The idea of phylotaxy music is to 
generate a front line from botanical 
parameters and to generate 
the notes of a musical theme from
this line.
