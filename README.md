## what is it ?

You use phylotaxy music, a web application, for 
generating a music
theme. A music theme is a small suite 
of music notes. Think of it as something you
 can whistle.

You edit your musical theme by turning 
knobs 
in the application. you can hear the result in 
the application by way of a simple 
websudio synthesizer.
If you want to compose something 
more elaborate, you can export it
to a musicxlm file and import it 
in
a score editing 
software like musescore.

Phylotaxy means "shape of leaves". 
It is the 
science botanist, mathematicians and physicists 
have developed to understand why plants
have the shape they have.

Those guys have fun jobs. In the office 
of one "spiral plants" specialist i 
visited, the shelves are full of beautiful 
dried 
spécimen that people send
from all over the world with questions 
about the shape of the arrangements
of the leaves.

For spital plants, 
Phylotaxy science has produced a concept, 
the "front line", that is interesting 
for music. If you draw a "front line"
on a paper and youndraw it again
on a tracing paper, you can check by 
moving the tracing paper that 
the front line overlaps itself
if you shift it a bit to the right and 
a bit to the top. The overlapping 
is perfect 
except for one space that have
the shape of an eye.

It happens that a musical theme 
suitable for polyphonic harmony,
a canon for instance,
is a theme that is played twice.
The second time the theme is played,
it is played with a 
shift in time and a shift in pitch 
(a fifth for instance).

The idea of phylotaxy music is to 
generate a front line from botanical 
parameters and to generate 
the notes of a musical theme from
this line.
