This the is plyllotaxy music generated site

You use phylotaxy music, a web application, for 
generating a music
theme. A music theme is a small suite 
of music notes, a melodic material.

A wellknown theme is at the start of Bach's 2nd 
fugue in C minor.

### Phylotaxy

Phylotaxy means "shape of leaves". 
It is the 
science developped by botanist, 
mathematicians and physicists 
to understand why plants
have the shape they have.

Those guys have fun jobs.

In the office of Stephane D.,
a "spiral plants" specialist I 
visited, the shelves are full of 
beautiful 
dried specimen that people 
sent to him
from all over the world. 
Each plant has spectacular
spiral arragenements of leaves
that run upward the trunks.

A common spiral plant is the pinecone.

Stephane taught me that when 
the trunk grows, 
the cells
at the stem divide themselves. New cells
 end up building
the trunk but regularly, 
one of them differentiates and
becomes a leave. 
Because this happens on a regular tempo, 
the leaves arrange themselves along 
the trunk
in spiral patterns. 
Stephane pointed out that if you draw
a curve around the trunk to isolate 
one leave cell from
newer leave cells, you end up drawing 
the "front curve"
of the plant growth.
